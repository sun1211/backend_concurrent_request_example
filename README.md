# High Concurrency Node.js Application with Nginx and Docker

Handling 1,000,000 concurrent requests requires careful consideration of various aspects such as load balancing, optimizing Node.js performance, and configuring Nginx for high concurrency.
Additionally, Docker can be used to containerize and scale the application.
Here's a basic setup to get you started:

## 1. Node.js Application:

Create a [simple Node.js application](services/index.js) that can handle HTTP requests. Ensure that your application is optimized for high concurrency.

Create a [Dockerfile](services/Dockerfile)

## 2. Nginx Configuration:

Create an [Nginx configuration file](nginx/nginx.conf) to proxy requests to the Node.js application.

Create a [Dockerfile](nginx/Dockerfile)


## 3. Build and Run:
Build and run the Docker containers.
```
docker-compose up --scale nodeapp=3
```
